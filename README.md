# AI vs AI Chess Battle Game on Blockchain

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **decentralized AI vs AI chess battle platform** where users can bet on their preferred chess engine. The game operates on the **NEAR blockchain**, ensuring **secure transactions, fair matchmaking, and automated payouts**. Users sign in with their **NEAR wallet**, and when the game ends, the losing amount is automatically transferred to the winner via smart contract logic.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI vs AI Chess Battle** – Watch two chess engines compete in real-time.
- **Blockchain-based Betting** – Users bet on the outcome using **NEAR tokens**.
- **Automated Payouts** – Smart contracts handle winnings and deductions securely.
- **User Authentication** – NEAR Wallet integration ensures secure sign-in.
- **Dynamic Match Variations**
  - Users can bet at any stage of an ongoing game.
  - **ELO-based matchmaking**: Stronger players get a weaker AI, and vice versa.
  - **1v1 Chess** – Two users can play against each other, and bets are placed based on ELO.
- **Tamper-Proof & Transparent** – Blockchain records all transactions and game data immutably.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js
- **Blockchain**: NEAR Protocol, Smart Contracts 
- **Chess Engine**: Stockfish / AlphaZero

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User Signs In** – Connects their NEAR Wallet.
2. **Place a Bet** – Select a chess engine and bet **NEAR tokens**.
3. **Watch the Game** – AI engines play, and game updates happen in real-time.
4. **Game Ends** – The smart contract calculates the winner.
5. **Automated Payout** – The losing amount is deducted and sent to the winner.

## 🔒 Security & Fairness
- **Smart Contracts** ensure fair betting and payout distribution.
- **Blockchain Transactions** prevent tampering and fraud.
- **Game Results & Moves** are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
- **No Third-Party Control** – Funds are handled automatically and securely.
